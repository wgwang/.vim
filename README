This is the development code of Vim-R-plugin. You should use it if you want
to contribute to its development (testing unreleased versions, fixing bugs,
writing code etc). You may want to adjust Vim's 'runtimepath' in your
~/.vimrc as in the example below:

set runtimepath=~/Vim-R-plugin,~/.vim,$VIMRUNTIME,~/.vim/after

Stable versions are released at
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628

Please, read the file doc/r-plugin.txt for usage details.
